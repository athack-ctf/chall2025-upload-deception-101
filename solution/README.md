# How to Solve the Challenge?

Provide reproducible steps to solve the challenge. This can include:

- create any non-image file and rename the extension to an acceptable immage type: [IMAGETYPE_JPEG, IMAGETYPE_PNG, IMAGETYPE_GIF, IMAGETYPE_WEBP]
- upload that file and the flag will be displayed on the screen
- any true image files will be accepted, but non-renamed and non-image files will be rejected.

Ensure that all dependencies required to build or run the solution are provided (e.g., `requirements.txt`) or thoroughly documented.
